hey hey! I've been stuck in tutorial hell for a while when it comes to coding, so I've decided that I'm going to begin building simple projects with the languages that I'm familiar with. 

I'll continously add to this repository as I create new mini projects, and this will act as a documentary of my progress and to hold me accountable for my learning :)
